Usage of slip type slip-on joints as the main means of pipe connection is not permitted except for cases where compensation of axial pipe deformation is necessary.   \nj\uff09 Application of mechanical joints and their acceptable use for each service is indicated in Tab 17; dependence upon the class of piping, pipe dimensions, working pressure and temperature is indicated in Tab 18.   \nk) In some particular cases, sizes in excess of those mentioned above may be accepted by the Society if they are in compliance with a recognised national and/or international standard.   \nI)Application of various mechanical joints may be accepted as indicated by Tab 17.

The bending length is taken as the length between the two main bearing midpoints (distance $\\mathsf{L}_{3},$ see Fig 2 (a) and Fig 2 (b).   \nb) The bending moments $M_{\\mathrm{BR}}$ and $M_{\\mathrm{BT}}$ are calculated in the relevant section based on triangular bending moment diagrams due to the radial component $\\mathsf{F}_{\\mathsf{R}}$ and the tangential component $\\mathsf{F}_{\\mathsf{T}}$ of the connecting rod force, respectively (see Fig 2 (a). For crank throws with two connecting rods acting upon one crankpin, the relevant bending moments are obtained by superposition of the two triangular bending moment diagrams according to phase (see Fig 2 (b).   \n\uff09 Bending moments and radial forces acting in web The bending moment $M_{\\mathrm{BRF}}$ and the radial force ${\\cal Q}_{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\mathrm{RF}}}$ are taken as acting in the centre of the solid web (distance $\\mathsf{L}_{1}$ in Fig 2) and are derived from the radial component of the connecting rod force. The alternating bending and compressive stresses due to bending moments and radial forces are to be related to the crosssection of the crank web: \u00b7 at the centre of the overlap S in cases of overlap of the pins (see Fig 3), and \u00b7at the centre of the distance y between the adjacent generating lines of the two pins in cases of pins which do not overlap (see Fig 4). This reference cross-section results from the web thickness W and the web width B (see Fig 3). Mean stresses are neglected.   \nd  Bending acting in outlet of crankpin oil bore The two relevant bending moments $M_{\\mathrm{BRO}}$ and $M_{\\mathrm{BTO}}$ (see Symbols and Fig 5) are taken in the crankpin cross-section through the oil bore. The alternating stresses due to these bending moments are to be related to the cross-sectional area of the axially bored crankpin. Mean bending stresses are neglected. ",
